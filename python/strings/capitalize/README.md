https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/capitalize/problem


**Problem**

You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports. For example, alison heck should be capitalised correctly as Alison Heck.

```
**alison hack => Alison Hack**
```

Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately.

**Input Format**

A single line of input containing the full name, **_S_**.

**Constraints**

- _0 < len(S) < 100_
- The string consists of alphanumeric characters and spaces.

**Note:** in a word only the first character is capitalized. Example 12abc when capitalized remains 12abc.

**Output Format**

Print the capitalized string, **_S_**.

**Sample Input**

```
chris alan
```

**Sample Output**

```
Chris Alan
```
