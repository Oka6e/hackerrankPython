## Problem

Lilah has a string, **s**, of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times.  

Given an integer, **n**, find and print the number of letter a's in the first  letters of Lilah's infinite string.  

For example, if the string **s='abcac'** and **n=10**, the substring we consider is **abcacabcac**, the first **10** characters of her infinite string. There are **4** occurrences of a in the substring.
